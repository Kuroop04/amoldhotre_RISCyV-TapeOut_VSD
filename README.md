## The RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program is a 20-week industry-grade course offered by VLSI System Design (VSD), focused on designing, verifying, and taping out a RISC-V-based System on Chip (SoC) using fully open-source tools. As part of Indiaâ€™s largest open-source silicon tapeout initiative, this program empowers participants to build their own custom RISC-V processor and take it all the way to physical design and GDSII generation.
